## Summary of Work Completed:

Today's session focused on implementing the missing functionality for tracking individual debt payments and ensuring the database migration system is robust and flexible.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Database Migration Overhaul:**
    *   Reconfigured the Alembic environment to be independent of the database engine, allowing seamless switching between SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production.
    *   Consolidated the entire database schema into a single, clean initial migration file, providing a solid foundation for future schema changes.

2.  **Debt Payment Feature Implementation:**
    *   Added the necessary Pydantic models (`DebtPaymentCreate`, `DebtPaymentUpdate`, `DebtPaymentResponse`) to `src/models/debt.py`.
    *   Implemented the backend logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting debt payments in `src/crud/crud_debt.py`.
    *   Exposed this functionality through a full suite of RESTful API endpoints in `src/routers/debts.py`.

## Current Project Status:

The API now fully supports all core features outlined in `GEMINI.md`, including the previously missing individual debt payment tracking. The project's database foundation is significantly more robust.

**Next Steps:**

*   The new endpoints for debt payments are ready for testing.
*   The application can be run using the command: `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`.

# Project Status Update - 2025-08-12

This document records the state of the project and the last interaction to ensure continuity.

## User's Last Request:

> do these routes support the core application features I defined in @GEMINI.md

## Agent's Last Response:

Yes, for the most part. The extensive refactoring and the creation of the new routers have established a strong foundation that directly supports the core features you outlined in `GEMINI.md`.

Here is a breakdown of how the current API routes align with your specified features:

1.  **Tracking transactions for a given user.**
    *   **Supported:** Yes.
    *   **How:** The `src/routers/transactions.py` router provides a full suite of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for transactions. You can create single or bulk transactions, retrieve them for a user (with filtering), and modify or delete them.

2.  **Allowing the user to create custom tags for transactions.**
    *   **Supported:** Yes.
    *   **How:** The `src/routers/tags.py` router fully supports this. You can create, view, update, and delete tags. Crucially, it also includes endpoints to associate tags with transactions, remove those associations, and retrieve all transactions for a given tag.

3.  **Allowing users to create custom budgets.**
    *   **Supported:** Yes.
    *   **How:** The `src/routers/budgets.py` router is very comprehensive. It allows you to create detailed budgets with specific categories and allocated amounts. You can also update budgets, manage their categories individually, and retrieve detailed performance and statistical data.

4.  **Allowing users to track debt payments and create debt repayment plans.**
    *   **Supported:** Partially.
    *   **How:** The `src/routers/debts.py` router fully supports the creation and management of **debt repayment plans** and their associated **payment schedules**. However, while the database schema includes a table for tracking individual `DebtPaymentDB` records, there are currently no CRUD operations or API endpoints to log, view, or manage these individual payments. The planning and scheduling part is done, but the payment tracking part is not yet exposed through the API.

5.  **Allowing users to track investment transactions and holdings to formulate their own "net worth" calculation.**
    *   **Supported:** Yes.
    *   **How:** The `src/routers/investments.py` router has distinct endpoints for managing both investment **holdings** and **transactions**. The system is designed to automatically update holding quantities based on new transactions. Furthermore, the `src/routers/accounts.py` router has a `/stats` endpoint that already calculates the user's total net worth by summing assets (including investment accounts) and subtracting liabilities.

In summary, the API provides robust support for almost all the core features. The only area that needs further development to be fully realized is the tracking of individual debt payments.
