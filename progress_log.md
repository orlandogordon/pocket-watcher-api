# Project Status Update - 2025-08-17

This document records the state of the project and the last interaction to ensure continuity.

## User's Last Request:

> please add this last response to the @progress_log.md file and also note that I want to create individual scripts to test each of these bulk upload endpoints. I also want to make sure there are the needed deletion endpoints for each data point. you can clear out whatever was previously in the @progress_log.md file as well

## Summary of Work Completed:

Today's session focused on adding bulk upload capabilities to several key endpoints to improve the efficiency of data import.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Bulk Upload for Financial Plan Entries:**
    *   Added the necessary Pydantic models to `src/models/financial_plan.py`.
    *   Implemented the backend logic in `src/crud/crud_financial_plan.py`.
    *   Exposed a new `POST /financial_plans/{plan_id}/entries/bulk-upload` endpoint in `src/routers/financial_plans.py`.

2.  **Bulk Upload for Investment Transactions:**
    *   Added the necessary Pydantic models to `src/models/investment.py`.
    *   Implemented the backend logic in `src/crud/crud_investment.py`.
    *   Exposed a new `POST /investments/transactions/bulk-upload` endpoint in `src/routers/investments.py`.

3.  **Bulk Upload for Debt Payments:**
    *   Added the necessary Pydantic models to `src/models/debt.py`.
    *   Implemented the backend logic in `src/crud/crud_debt.py`.
    *   Exposed a new `POST /debt/payments/bulk-upload` endpoint in `src/routers/debts.py`.

## Next Steps:

*   Create individual test scripts for each of the new bulk upload endpoints to ensure they are working as expected.
*   Verify that there are corresponding deletion endpoints for each of the data points that can be bulk uploaded, to ensure data can be managed effectively.
